<h3>About m9digitech</h3>
<p>m9 Digital Suite is located at the South Western end of M Block and it was redesigned a few years ago to become a Computer Suite dedicated for Digital Technologies. It has 30 HP desktop computers which run Windows 10 with a varieties of Educational software applications available for students to use.<br/>
Unlike all other ICT rooms, m9 computers are among the most powerful computers for students around the school and also include specific software applications for its courses. Those specifications enable students to perform specific tasks during class time without any issues in terms of machine speed and connection speed.<br/>
m9 Classes were the first in the college to convert all resources into digital but it was only restricted to internal access. That means, students do not need an exercise book or pens or ruler etc. Everything was done digitally on the computer. The resources from the teacher was stored on the student shared drive, students will then download it onto their account. Students work were then uploaded onto the Student Dropbox then the teacher collect students work from the Student Dropbox. Students only have a one-way direction permission to access either the Student Shared drive or the Student Dropbox.<br/>
Since the lockdown in March 2020, m9 Resources were then uploaded to OneNote Online then eventually moved onto Teams. All the m9 Resources will now be uploaded to Teams and we'll try and explore the power of Teams in terms of Online Learning and Teaching.</p>
